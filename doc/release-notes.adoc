= Release notes for NPL

== Version 0.6

- Language and the interpreter support for _sanctions_. See link:../examples/e4.npl[example4] and JaCaMo link:https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/tree/develop/demos/sanction[demo]. Core ideas: 
  * Final state of norm instances (fulfilled, unfulfilled or inactive) may trigger sanctions
  * Two kinds of sanction procedures: obligation and (institutional) fact of type sanction. In the former, an agent is obliged to do something as the consequence of the (un)fulfillment, as a kind of chain of norms. In the latter, the fact can be read either by an agent that decides how to proceed or by an artifact that _regiments_ the consequence of the (un)fulfillment. 

- API changes:
  * class DeonticModality is renamed to NormInstance
  * class NormFactory is renamed to NPLFactory
